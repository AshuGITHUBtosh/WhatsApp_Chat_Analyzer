1/4/24, 12:41 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: can i get permission to dismantle the nozzle?
1/4/24, 12:41 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Coz I've been saying from quite a long time that investing in this printer is waste
1/4/24, 12:41 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: U can do it with me
1/4/24, 12:42 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: But again
1/4/24, 12:42 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Why put more money in buying new parts to replace
1/4/24, 12:42 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: no buying parts
1/4/24, 12:42 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Nothing can't be done without that
1/4/24, 12:42 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Its the heating problem again
1/4/24, 12:43 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Acc to me the bowden tube has melted again or some shit
1/4/24, 12:43 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Or it has so many problems with its motherboard now that it just doesn't want to print
1/4/24, 12:43 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: maybe not this
1/4/24, 12:44 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: hardware issue only
1/4/24, 12:44 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: It has problem with me🤡
1/4/24, 12:44 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Whenever im near it fks up
1/4/24, 12:45 PM - ANIRUDH Manager Team Vyadh: Makes sense
1/4/24, 2:47 PM - Dalton VIT: Find a way to fix the problem first. Know why it is not printing correctly
1/4/24, 2:49 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Pla is not coming from nozzle while a print is going on ok
1/4/24, 2:50 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: But the moment u stop the print
1/4/24, 2:50 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: The nozzle works perfectly
1/4/24, 2:50 PM - Dalton VIT: S but y???
1/4/24, 2:51 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: thats what we need to figure out
1/4/24, 2:51 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: ig
1/4/24, 2:51 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Its weird i have never seen this kind of problem bcz if a nozzle is clogged
1/4/24, 2:51 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: It doesn't work until u clean it
1/4/24, 2:51 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: But this mf works the sec u stop the print
1/4/24, 3:03 PM - Dalton VIT: Exactly 🫡
1/4/24, 3:03 PM - Dalton VIT: Check wht r the other possibilities of this problem
1/4/24, 3:05 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: I think while its printing the pla doesn't melt instantly which causes it to clog but thats not it
1/4/24, 3:06 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Bcz if it was like that then it wouldn't have been printing the brim and stuff also
1/4/24, 3:06 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: The error comes at a specific height
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: So acc to me its some computational problem
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: Then shift the base plate to a higher position 😀
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Like the motherboard is fked
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Dalton VIT: Is the reach of the pla to the extruder gud???
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Yes it is
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: But the bowden tube kight also be a problem
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Might*
1/4/24, 3:07 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: Will have to open it tonight

2/24/24, 1:38 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: 💀
2/26/24, 3:03 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: The first one is crossword. The March issue is themed Space-time and Black Holes, so most of the words should be related to that. The hints should be a little formal and riddle-like, just as those in crosswords that come in newspapers. Reference can be taken from the January or February edition and of course I'll be available to clear any doubts you have.

The second one is another word game, and a difficult, somewhat lengthy word is chosen based on the theme. The hints are given for 3 or 4 letters, and a master hint is provided for the entire word.

Preferably two volunteers per game :)
2/26/24, 3:03 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: Anyone interested to volunteer for the seds newsletter for march?
2/26/24, 3:06 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: Please inform at the earliest

3/12/24, 7:47 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Getting half way there in the first task itself is tougher than the whole IRC
3/12/24, 7:47 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: but then its written that even with a 30 derg slope it should fit
3/12/24, 7:48 PM - Raghav Bharadia Team Vyadh: No doubt last years teams got 0 ,like 12 out of 20 teams
3/12/24, 7:48 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Thas not an issue, with ig52s
3/12/24, 7:48 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: lol

Manual control-green
Autonomous control-yelloe
Emergeny-red
3/12/24, 7:52 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: Each mission has a light indicator
3/12/24, 7:53 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: which means that their missions are such that u have to toggle between manual or stuff I think
3/12/24, 7:53 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Intervention me bhi mission time deduct hota rahega
3/12/24, 7:53 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Exactly
3/12/24, 7:53 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: Yup
3/12/24, 7:53 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: yep like irc

4/30/24, 11:40 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: Justify your self
4/30/24, 11:41 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Higher potential cloud, lowe potential cloud 

Polarised air acts as a conduction channel

Charges flow
4/30/24, 11:41 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Hence 🌩️🌩️🌩️⚡⚡⚡
4/30/24, 11:41 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: Tf explanation is this
4/30/24, 11:41 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: I feel like its kinda like an discharging capacitor
4/30/24, 11:41 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: Close
4/30/24, 11:42 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Same as a parallel plate capacitor with high voltage, and small distance between platws
4/30/24, 11:42 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: Same
4/30/24, 11:42 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: But when its shorted

4/30/24, 11:42 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: Who ?
4/30/24, 11:42 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: Instead of having a resistor
4/30/24, 11:42 PM - Anagh Verma Team Vyadh: It also polarises the air in between the platws
4/30/24, 11:42 PM - Abiram Team Vyadh: Gourav and Abhiram???

5/2/24, 4:23 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: 🫥
5/2/24, 4:23 PM - ANIRUDH Manager Team Vyadh: and only me and Raghav know what happened in the meeting with the cap and vice cap
5/2/24, 4:23 PM - Spoorthi Team Vyadh: Also , bro our entire team should know what happens in poc , half of the things in poc group I could give solution to
5/2/24, 4:24 PM - ANIRUDH Manager Team Vyadh: that we cant do rn
5/2/24, 4:24 PM - Spoorthi Team Vyadh: Ik
5/2/24, 4:24 PM - ANIRUDH Manager Team Vyadh: its the board decision not me right
5/2/24, 4:24 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: yea someone needs to let some software person know that half the things we asked for isn't even there (even tho first draft mein it was there so like wtf)
5/2/24, 4:25 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: yea we know we r talking abt board only 
I'd like to tell someone that 90% things that were done (by other domain ppl if I'm being specific) in the night 2 hrs before the deadline could've been completed a long long time ago
5/2/24, 4:25 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: didn't love Sarthak bhaiya's comment abt *using our common sense* in the grp <This message was edited>
5/2/24, 4:25 PM - ANIRUDH Manager Team Vyadh: so did I
5/2/24, 4:25 PM - nandhitha shri:)) Team Vyadh: Brother had no idea that we had to update science part in the final ppt
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - Spoorthi Team Vyadh: Broo fr @918328502149 , in the draft u could have sent it in the vyadh informal , autonomous part of the video is literally a joke none of the things we shoot is there the good ones , just one message and i would be stayed up the entire night editing , broo anirudh all these draft videos share it in common group
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: because if common sense came from the other side it'd be pretty obvious that budget report. transcript, video shoots all are things that could've been like 2 months ago they're not dependant on the shooting of the rover moving .
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: yea
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: anirudh if u can let the seniors know that we wanna talk to them do tell them
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: cuz I would LOVVEE to have a nice long chat
5/2/24, 4:26 PM - Spoorthi Team Vyadh: @918328502149 u should let everyone know
5/2/24, 4:27 PM - Spoorthi Team Vyadh: Literally
5/2/24, 4:27 PM - nandhitha shri:)) Team Vyadh: I do too
5/2/24, 4:29 PM - ANIRUDH Manager Team Vyadh: ok I apologise for what happened, I will talk to the seniors and make sure that everyone will get to know abt everything
5/2/24, 4:29 PM - nandhitha shri:)) Team Vyadh: Okay
5/2/24, 4:29 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: ppl r pretending the arc dates were given 3 days ago or smtjng and then getting mad at the ppl who actually did work when asked to do it last minute (was under the impression that certain things were already done). so I would love to discuss that
5/2/24, 4:30 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: see bro its not abt u
5/2/24, 4:30 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: we wanna talk to seniors

5/2/24, 4:46 PM - Raghav Bharadia Team Vyadh: Let me tell you just one thing, if i had not been sick the night, the editor was supposed to work on meet with me, nothing of this sort would have happened
5/2/24, 4:47 PM - nandhitha shri:)) Team Vyadh: Bro one night was not gonna make a difference
5/2/24, 4:47 PM - nandhitha shri:)) Team Vyadh: We should’ve started this way earlier
5/2/24, 4:47 PM - Keerthana Team Vyadh: no it still would've because this isn't just abt the video all the other parts of the doc were also fucked because of horrible planning
5/2/24, 4:47 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: editor should have some sense himself
5/2/24, 4:47 PM - Raghav Bharadia Team Vyadh: He was given a full day, and he was an"editor" so i thought with directions he could do it
5/2/24, 4:47 PM - nandhitha shri:)) Team Vyadh: Bro you have to give it to him Atleast two days prior
5/2/24, 4:48 PM - nandhitha shri:)) Team Vyadh: We decided the final draft an hour before uploading

5/2/24, 4:49 PM - Raghav Bharadia Team Vyadh: See next time the solution is quite simple, we have enough recruits in mgmt, they are supposed to do the work by themselves no outsourcing of the work will be done from now on
5/2/24, 4:49 PM - Tanmay Pahuja Team Vyadh: nobody is stopping anyone go on👍🏻
5/2/24, 4:50 PM - Spoorthi Team Vyadh: @917042771497 @917418938461 , @919116155335 why can't u guys answer the poll , this is serious , arnt u guys part of the team

5/2/24, 4:51 PM - Spoorthi Team Vyadh: Sorry my bad
5/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sarthak TEAM VYADH: Same here, done
5/2/24, 4:52 PM - Raghav Bharadia Team Vyadh: Now coming to the clips part, i have never seen such an editor who would choose a low light clip with gaps of no movement over a perfectly lit and shorter and direct clip
5/2/24, 4:52 PM - Sarthak TEAM VYADH: You know I missed 2 of my DA submissions yesterday because of that document thing.
5/2/24, 4:53 PM - Mithilesh Gupta TEAM VYADH: Guys
